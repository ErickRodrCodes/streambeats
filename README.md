# Streambeats

A compilation of streambeats albums in mp3 format, 360kbps studio mode.

## Why?

While I stream I found frustrating at start to get albums properly tagged in my overlay player and stream players, so those can fetch artorks and related information. Raw files does not contain such info, and for that reason I decided to build this repo to allow anyone to get access to the library, with tags and artworks in a easy way using Git.

## Objective

The purpose of this repo is to mirror the Streambeats albums, with the only difference that you will get files in MP3 Format @ 360kbps studio quality, with correct ID3 tags, and correct artwork.

[Streambeats](https://www.streambeats.com) is licence-free DMCA music that you can use in your streamimg platforms.
