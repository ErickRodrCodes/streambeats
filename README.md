# Streambeats

A compilation of streambeats albums in mp3 format, 360kbps studio mode.

## Why?

I found frustrating at start to get albums properly tagged my player and stream players to fetch artorks and related information, reason why I decided to build this repo to allow anyone to get access to the library in a easy way using Git.

## Objective

The purpose of this repo is to mirror the Streambeats albums, with the only difference that you will get files in MP3 Format @ 360kbps studio quality, with correct ID3 tags, and correct artwork.
